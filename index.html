        <h2 class="about">ABOUT ME.</h2>
        <p class="mine">Welcome! I'm Emmanuel Ombogo, a passionate and driven graphic designer, currently pursuing my second year in Computer Science. My love for technology and creativity
            allows me to merge design and innovation in ways that deliveer impactful, visually stunning designs.
            I specialize in creating eye-catching posters, business cards, event promotions and digital branding, always ensuring that each piece is toilored to 
            the unique needs of my clients. 
            <br><br>
            Beyond graphic design I'm deeply invested in content creation, particularly exploring the theme of childhood memories. 
            I believe that our past experiences shape our creative expression, an I aim to weave this nostalgia into meaningful stories through visuals and multimedia. 
            This pesonal approach not only sets my work apart but also connects to a deeper emotional level with my audience.
             <br><br>
            Whether you are looking for a fresh and innovative design for your business, event or personal project, I am here to bring your ideas to life.
            Let's work together to create something unforgettable!
